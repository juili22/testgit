Install
=======

From PyPI
:::::::::

The software is packaged as `git-semver` on PyPI, you can install it using `pip` (or `easy_install`, if you live in the
past). It can work globally (if you have the correct rights) or locally in a virtualenv, usual business.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git-semver

From GitHub
:::::::::::

Wanna hack on `git-semver`?

Just clone it and use an "editable install".

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/hartym/git-semver.git
    pip install -e ./git-semver
